# ConbiniWars
Got bored, had some drinks and started a little project. In my neighborhood there is seemingly only Lawson conbinis. This lead me to take a look at how common these pockets of exclusive territory are. This is a pretty surface level analysis of all locations of conbini in Japan. (Only the top few brands)


## TODO:
- [ ] Add the scripts for processing all of the conbini locations into the geojson that populates the frontend to the repo
- [ ] Check out manhattan voronoi style for territory calculation. So the territory follows streets and geographical features.
- [ ] Some UI polish
- [ ] Streamline some resouce loading
